### Data Description

Each row in the dataset represents the sourcing of one unit of a particular product combination. A unique product combination is defined by attributes in columns A, B, C, D, E, and F. Therefore, multiple rows with the same combination may exist in the training dataset, where each row represents the purchase of one unit.

### Dataset Split

The training dataset spans from July 2020 to May 2021, while the test dataset consists of June 2021 data. The goal is to forecast or predict the sourcing quantities for June 2021 based on the 11 months of training data (from June 2020 to May 2021). In the test set, June 2021 contains only one value for each combination, serving as the target for prediction.

### Summary

The dataset comprises sourcing information for various product combinations. Each row represents the acquisition of one unit of a specific product combination. With the training dataset spanning 11 months from June 2020 to May 2021, the task is to predict the sourcing quantities for June 2021. This prediction is based on historical data and attributes such as A, B, C, D, E, and F, which define unique product combinations.
